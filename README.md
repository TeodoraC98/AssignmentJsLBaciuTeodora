Being a lover of online shopping, for this project I chose to create a web page for an online store.
To create a web page that works well for the purpose of online shopping, the project is designed in 3 essential parts: Homepage, login page and product view pages. 
Due to limited resources and lack of a database, the data is stored in the local JSON file. To access the information, the web page must be opened on a live server.
